## User Story

As an employee with a busy schedule, I want to add important events to a daily planner, so that I can manage my time effectively.

## Acceptance Criteria

* When I open the planner,then the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* When I scroll down, then I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* When I view the time blocks for that day, then each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* When I click into a time block, then I can enter an event
* When I click the save button for that time block, then the text for that event is saved in local storage
* When I refresh the page, then the saved events persist
